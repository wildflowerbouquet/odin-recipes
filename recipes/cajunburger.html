     <div class="recipe">
       <h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>
          <li>1lb ground beef</li>
          <li>1 egg</li>
          <li>1/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
          <li>1/4 cup BBQ sauce (use Jack Miller's Bar-B-Que sauce for extra Cajun-ness, but any BBQ sauce works!)</li>
          <li>Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning to taste</li>
          <li>PepperJack Cheese</li>
          <li>Hamburger buns</li>
          <li>All your favorite burger fixins</li>
       </ul>

       <h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
       <ol>
          <li>Grilling gives the best flavor, but if you don't have a grill, heat a skillet on medium high.</li>

          <li>Bring the ground beef to room temperature. Use your hands or a potato masher to combine ground beef, egg, and breadcrumbs until they're evenly mixed. Add the BBQ sauce and Tony's and mix again.</li>

          <li>Divide ground beef into four equal patties, about 1/4 inch thick. When the skillet is nice and hot, place the patties in and flatten with a spatula. Let them cook until the edges are brown, about 5 minutes. Flip and let cook until the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. Turn the heat off, add the cheese, and cover until the cheese melts. Place on a plate with a paper towel.</li>

          <li>Assemble your fixins. Place burgers on buns, add your favorite toppings, and enjoy!</li>
